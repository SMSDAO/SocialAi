# 🌐 SocialAi  
### The Open Social Index & Identity Claim Network

SocialAi is a lightweight, AI‑powered social discovery engine that mirrors public Farcaster activity, blends optional Reddit timelines, and exposes SEO‑optimized public profiles that users can claim by verifying their Farcaster identity.

It is built on a **parallel, auto‑healing, one‑file node architecture** powered by Healdec and SmartBrain.
